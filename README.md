# flightdelay
Airport arrival performance and other events are affected by weather, which may result in delays or capacity constraints. These uncertainties during airport operations can .the airport authority wants to analyze the flights that are delayed and the effect of weather on the delays.
* Weather: Out of 2201 flights, 1773 (80%) are on time, and 428 (20%) are delayed.
* Delay: Delayed flights total 428 (20%), while on-time flights total 1773 (80%).
* The highest number of flights are during the morning and noon, while the night period had the least flights.
* According to Weather Histogram weather has small effect on airplanes delay.
* Some days show larger variation in delays day 19 and 21, with wider boxes and longer whiskers, while other days 18 and 25 have small or no delay variation.
* Carrier Performance: Delta Airlines has many flights, so it is important to look at how often their flights are delayed compared to other airlines.
* Airport Operations: DCA has a lot of flights, which could cause delays. Checking the delays at this airport might help understand any problems.
* Weather Impact: There are not many delayed flights because of weather, so other reasons might be causing the delays.
  * Traffic Patterns: The day of the week and time of day may affect delays. Afternoons have more flights, which could lead to more delays.
    # Weather-Related Delays:
- Long Delays (more than 1 hour): 53% of weather delays last over an hour. This shows that when weather causes a delay, it’s often serious.
-	Short Delays (up to 30 minutes): Only 37.5% of weather delays are short, meaning most weather delays are longer.
# Non-Weather-Related Delays:
-	Short Delays (up to 30 minutes): Almost 59% of non-weather delays are short, which means most of these delays aren’t too long.
-	Long Delays (more than 1 hour): Around 29% of non-weather delays are long, much lower than for weather-related delays.
  # Weather tends to cause longer delays, while most non-weather delays are short and under 30 minutes.
  * LaGuardia Airport has the most flights and the most short delays.
* Newark Airport and Kennedy Airport have many long delays.
